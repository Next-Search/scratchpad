# Introduction
We don't claim omniscience and part of this nextproposal is seeking out the wisdom of you our readers to help us make the best decisions. What we've listed below is a preliminary set of technologies / services / etc. we believe could be useful in our endeavors to create a better search engine. We'd love to hear your thoughts - feel free to make pull requests or shoot us an email at nextsearch@protonmail.com.

# The Index
One of the historical challenges to starting and maintaining a search engine is the creation of an appropriate and updated index against which queries are run. We believe that [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) will provide a great seeding source for nextsearch. It will not be the extent of our index but when our index does not have other, better results available Common Crawl may be a robust resource.

# The Search Engine
There are several robust search engine options currently available in the open source world. Among those we have found most attractive:
- [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/).
- [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/).
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).

# Gamification
We think [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) has created a robust gamification / authority system which is worth analyzing and adapting.

# Data Storage
We believe that users should own their data and we hope that this data will be in a open and common format that can be easily ported by users between different search engines.

One step in this direction is the implementation of user owned storage. We are particularly interested in:

- [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org/) with its Gaia storage system.
- [remoteStorage](https://remotestorage.io/) which already integrates with a number of popular data storage providers (including Google Drive).
- [Solid](https://solid.inrupt.com/) which offers PODs and comes from none other than Tim Berners-Lee.

# Monetization
We are particularly interested in using alternative monetization methods such as:

- [Brave](https://brave.com/) / [Basic Attention Token (BAT)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) which was founded by Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript.
- [Coil](https://coil.com/) which is partnering with [Mozilla](https://mozilla.com) and [CreativeCommons](https://creativecommons.org) to provide $100 million in funding to make a better web.

# Cryptocurrency
Heck, we figure if we mention cryptocurrency enough times its bound to attract attention. But seriously, we do think cryptocurrencies could play a role in our solution. One project we've followed for a long time is [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/).

# Blockchain
Throwing another buzzword in here but for serious reasons. We think that using the blockchain could be an excellent way to authenticate and validate web content and search rankings...more on this later.

# Identity
As will be seen elsewhere in our proposal, authenticating identity will play an important role in the way the search engine operates.

[Keybase](https://keybase.io) looks interesting, not least because [Chris Coyne](@malgorithms) is there and his previous work on [OkCupid](https://okcupid.com/) is quite inspirational.
