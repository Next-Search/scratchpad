# Introduction
We don't claim omniscience and part of this nextproposal is seeking out the wisdom of you our readers to help us make the best decisions. What we've listed below is a preliminary set of technologies / services / etc. we believe could be useful in our endeavors to create a better search engine. We'd love to hear your thoughts - feel free to make pull requests or shoot us an email at nextsearch@protonmail.com.

# The Index
One of the historical challenges to starting and maintaining a search engine is the creation of an appropriate and updated index against which queries are run. We believe that [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) will provide a great seeding source for nextsearch. It will not be the extent of our index but when our index does not have other, better results available Common Crawl may be a robust resource.

# The Search Engine
There are several robust search engine options currently available in the open source world. Among those we have found most attractive:
- [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/).
- [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/).
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/).

# Gamification
We think [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) has created a robust gamification / authority system which is worth analyzing and adapting.
