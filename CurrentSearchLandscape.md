# The Major Players
1. [Google](https://google.com/)
2. [Bing](https://bing.com/)
3. [Baidu](https://baidu.com/) - Chinese Search Engine.
4. [Yandex](https://yandex.com/) - Russion Search Engine.
5. [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) - Probably the best known alternative search engine, quite popular due to its privacy-centric nature.
