# Introduction
There have been so many search engines - big ones, little ones, niche and general, algorithmic and social - the list goes on. The point is, we aren't unaware of those who have gone before us...and if we .are we hope you'll share a pull request or shoot us an email at nextsearch@protonmail.com.

In this document we will briefly mention a number of these predecessors and, where helpful, explain why we believe individual endeavors were unsuccessful and how we believe we can overcome similar problems.

# Blekko
Technically Blekko didn't die, it was acquired by IBM, who in their wisdom closed Blekko. The lesson here is one seen often with web search engines: acquisition usually means death.

We don't think there is anything particularly wrong with being acquired or having acquisition as an end game - but that isn't what nextsearch is about...we'll be looking to flesh out exactly how we'll ensure this in the future.
