There have been so many search engines - big ones, little ones, niche and general, algorithmic and social - the list goes on. The point is, we aren't unaware of those who have gone before us...and if we .are we hope you'll share a pull request or shoot us an email at nextsearch@protonmail.com.

In this document we will briefly mention a number of these predecessors and, where helpful, explain why we believe individual endeavors were unsuccessful and how we believe we can overcome similar problems.
